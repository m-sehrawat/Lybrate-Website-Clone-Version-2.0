                        "Depression is referred to as clinical depression. It is a mood disorder related to emotional and physical problems. The condition is characterised by a persistent or continuing feeling of sadness, hopelessness, anger and/or loss of interest. The condition is different from the occasional bouts of sadness. Depression usually requires the medical attention.If left untreated, the condition can take a toll on the physical, emotional and social well-being of an individual.",
                        "The Different Forms of Depression",
                        "Major Depression: This is one of the most common and severe types of depression. It is associated with a chronic or recurring feeling of sadness, loneliness, worthlessness and hopelessness.It is diagnosed when the symptoms persist for 2 weeks or longer.",
                        "Persistent Depressive Disorder: The persistent depression lasts for 2 or more years. Some of the most common symptoms of persistent depressive disorder are poor energy levels, lethargy, difficulty in thinking and concentrating, feeling hopeless, poor appetite, sleeping too much or too little etc.",
                        "Bipolar Disorder: Bipolar Disorder is a depression that is characterised by mood episodes that vary from phases of extremely high energy to low depressive periods. It is also known as manic depression.",
                        "Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD): This occurs periodically mostly during the winter time when you get less sunlight. It usually gets resolved with the onset of spring or summer.",

                        "Can you inherit depression?",
                        "It has been found in the studies that, in 40% of the cases, depression can be traced back to the genetic link. apart from the genetic environmental factors also play an important role in the occurrence of depression. However, people who have siblings or parents with depression have higher chances of inheriting the condition rather than the others. The heritability of depression is about 40%, this can be higher in severe cases. However, the rest is related to external factors. Depression is biological as it has been found to be related to the genetic, neurological hormonal, immunological, and neuroendocrinological mechanisms of the body. The above-mentioned mechanisms play an important role in the body's reaction to stress and the processing of emotions. The high level of serotonin in the body causes a feeling of elation or happiness while the low levels of serotonin cause sadness, low mood and is thus linked to depression. Apart from depression, the low serotonin levels in the body can cause other mental issues such as anger management issues, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or panic attacks."

Having too much glucose in blood can cause health issues and if the blood glucose, also known as blood sugar, is too high in any person it is called diabetes. Blood glucose is the major source of energy and comes from the diet which is consumed. The body contains a hormone named as Insulin that helps the glucose to get into the cells so as to provide energy. There are various types of diabetes like Type-1, Type –II, gestational and pre-diabetes. When a person suffers from diabetes the body does not makes insulin and thus the glucose fails to gets into the body cells and stays in the blood. This raised blood sugar level or glucose level can cause problems like eye damage, kidney damage, heart diseases, etc. Thus diabetes can be a serious condition if left untreated. While diabetes has no permanent cure, it can get steps to handle diabetes of a person and keep on healthy and fit life.",

                        "Type 1 diabetes: The immune system of a person mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. In some people genes also play a role in the cause of this disease. Thus, insulin is not produced and thus there is high blood glucose.",
                        "Type 2 diabetes: This occurs due to insulin resistance. It is the combination of genetics and lifestyle factors such as being overweight or obese increases the risk of this problem. Due to heavy weight in the belly the cells become more resistant to the effects of insulin on blood sugar.",
                        "Gestational diabetes: The main cause of this problem is hormonal changes during pregnancy. The placenta produces hormones and these hormones can make cells less sensitive to the effects of insulin. This can cause high blood sugar during pregnancy. Through proper diet this disease can be prevented.",

                        "Hair loss, also known as alopecia or baldness, refers to a loss of hair from part of the head or body. Typically at least the head is involved. The severity of hair loss can vary from a small area to the entire body. Typically inflammation or scarring is not present. Hair fall in some people causes psychological distress. Everybody loses some hair every day. Research has shown that a person can lose up to 100 hairs per day. But losing more hair can cause bald spots to appear on a man’s head. In case of a woman, there is thinning of the hair on the top of her head. Hair fall is not a life-threatening condition. But it can become seriously jeopardize one’s self-confidence by drastically changing for the worse how he/she looks. Men, women and even children can experience hair loss. This condition occurs generally as a result of hormonal changes, heredity, medical conditions or as a side-effect of some medications. Hair loss due to hereditary reasons is the most common cause of hair fall.",

                        "Can you inherit depression?",
                        "It has been found in the studies that, in 40% of the cases, depression can be traced back to the genetic link. apart from the genetic environmental factors also play an important role in the occurrence of depression. However, people who have siblings or parents with depression have higher chances of inheriting the condition rather than the others. The heritability of depression is about 40%, this can be higher in severe cases. However, the rest is related to external factors. Depression is biological as it has been found to be related to the genetic, neurological hormonal, immunological, and neuroendocrinological mechanisms of the body. The above-mentioned mechanisms play an important role in the body's reaction to stress and the processing of emotions. The high level of serotonin in the body causes a feeling of elation or happiness while the low levels of serotonin cause sadness, low mood and is thus linked to depression. Apart from depression, the low serotonin levels in the body can cause other mental issues such as anger management issues, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), or panic attacks."
